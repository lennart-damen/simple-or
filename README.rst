``simpleor`` is a package that helps you solve Operations Research problems.
Currently, ``simpleor`` supports:

- a scheduler, which assigns tasks to agents
- a matcher, which finds a maximum matching in fully connected graph

You can use this functionality directly, or use the package as a starting point to create
your own Operations Research solvers.
